# Web scraping exercise

Upon a request from a linkedin contact asking for assistance on a web scraping task I came out with the solution below. The issue was posted in StackOverflow in this link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61965809/beautifulsoup-how-to-get-href-links-from-pseudo-element-class.

This solution is an alternate approach to the code provided in the post.

The goal of this script it to obtain a list of all articles published in "Chronobiology International.
The Journal of Biological and Medical Rhythm Research". Each item of the list comprises another list containing the Volume and issue number as the first object, followed by the titles of the articles.
